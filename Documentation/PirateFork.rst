About This Fork
---------------

This is essentially the main original repo with all of the pending pull requests included except for pull request no. 29.  The reason it is not included is it conflicts with another change and, of the two, appears to be the least useful.

The purpose of the fork, or continuance, is to meet the some of the many and varied needs of Australian Internet users at this time.  Now that the Australian Parliament have sold legislation; specifically they have allowed foreign corporations to purchase legislation enabling corporate censorship of Australian citizens, we need as many tools as possible to circumvent the attempts to use that legislation.  Hence the name of the fork, since we all know that it will be the content monopolists who will use this legislation.
